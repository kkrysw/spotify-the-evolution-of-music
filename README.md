# About Spotify: The Evolution of Music

This repository contains two projects undertaken throughout the 2023-2024 academic year, as detailed below:

**(1) spotify-capstone:** The Spotify Capstone Project was finished as of May 2024 for the Principles of Data Science course at New York University. Given a dataset of ~52,000 songs, I simulate the statistical tests and data analyses of a hypothetical Data Scientist at Spotify. 
This project centers upon 10 questions specifically designed to **understand the relationship between musical features and song popularity.** A detailed written report of my reasoning can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vx1pk9q21XxF2GJkJSep8bKQk7LQYPo8C42VD045Sp0/edit?usp=sharing

**(2) spotify-expo:** The Spotify Exposition Project was finished as of December 2023 for the Data Science Exposition at New York University. Given a dataset of ~11,000 songs from 1986-2023, this project analyzes **trends in musical features and how they have changed in songs over time.** This project was finished with a proposal of possible **time-series analysis models I would use to predict prevalant features of popular songs in the future,** giving both artists and listeners a more quantitative understanding of where music and streaming is headed towards. The presentation given for this project at the Data Science Exposition can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EoodeVq6HzEBjBmqY7aWUQA0m4hnVjIb8RHnwzHvquw/edit?usp=sharing
